<h1> Phishing Threat Detection and Analysis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved a lab exercise focused on the analysis of a suspicious .eml file to identify and report on a potential phishing attempt. Using manual analysis of email headers and content, the project successfully identified key indicators of compromise, including SPF failure, a discrepancy between "From" and "Reply-To" addresses, and a spoofed return path.
<br />

<h2>Key Analysis Objectives:</h2>

- <b2> Email Header Analysis: Understanding the structure and significance of key email headers (e.g., Received, Authentication-Results, From, Reply-To). </b2>
- <b2> Email Authentication Protocols: Recognizing the role of SPF in preventing spoofing and interpreting authentication results. </b2>
- <b2> Incident Response Fundamentals: Practicing the initial steps of a security response, including threat identification, analysis, and simulated containment/notification. </b2>


<b2> This project highlights a fundamental skill in threat analysis and security operations: the ability to identify and respond to social engineering attacks. </b2>

<h1> Malware Threat Detection and Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved a hands-on analysis of a network packet capture (.pcap) file to detect and analyze malware activity. By systematically examining network traffic, I successfully identified key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), including suspicious IP addresses, malicious URLs, and infected file hashes.
<br />

<h2>Approach:</h2>
My approach began with an initial triage of the Wireshark capture, followed by cross-referencing all suspicious network indicators with external threat intelligence sources (VirusTotal). This correlation allowed for a high-confidence confirmation of malicious activity and the identification of the malware's communication channels.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Tools Used:</b>
- <b2> Wireshark </b2>

- <b2> VirusTotal </b2>


<b2> This project demonstrated practical skills in network traffic analysis, threat intelligence utilization, and incident response methodology. It reinforced the importance of network packets as a primary source of forensic evidence and highlighted the value of a structured approach to threat hunting and analysis. </b2>
