<h1>Threat Detection and Analysis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved a lab exercise focused on the analysis of a suspicious .eml file to identify and report on a potential phishing attempt. Using manual analysis of email headers and content, the project successfully identified key indicators of compromise, including SPF failure, a discrepancy between "From" and "Reply-To" addresses, and a spoofed return path.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Key Analysis Objectives:</h2>

- <b2> Email Header Analysis: Understanding the structure and significance of key email headers (e.g., Received, Authentication-Results, From, Reply-To). </b2>
- <b2> Email Authentication Protocols: Recognizing the role of SPF in preventing spoofing and interpreting authentication results. </b2>
- <b2> Incident Response Fundamentals: Practicing the initial steps of a security response, including threat identification, analysis, and simulated containment/notification. </b2>
<br />

<b> This project highlights a fundamental skill in threat analysis and security operations: the ability to identify and respond to social engineering attacks. </b>
